# Javascript software rasterizer

Renders 3D models using a custom triangle function, the color of the triangles correspond to their normal in world space (RGB = XYZ).

I also encoded the 3D model as a png image, which is decoded for rendering, the code is included in [objImgConverter.js](https://github.com/sdegueldre/software-renderer/blob/master/objImgConverter.js)
